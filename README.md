# Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the VenMAS, Verification of Neural Multi Agent Systems, toolkit. 
VenMAS allows to verify the behaviour of multi-agent systems against bounded temporal properties,
where agents and/or environment may have neural components. This includes 
* neural agents, i.e., agents whose protocol function is implemented as a neural network.
* neural interpreted systems (NIS), where each agent has
  * an observation function implemented as a neural network and
  * a symbolic protocol function that returns a set of valid actions for each current state and observation
